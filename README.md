# VizTA
VizTA is an interactive reading module designed to enhance comprehension of distributional visualizations through a visual-lexical fused conversational interface.

## Paper

This repository contains the implementation of VISTA, which is described in our EuroVis 2025 paper:

> VISTA: Enhancing Comprehension of Distributional Visualization with Visual-Lexical Fused Conversational Interface

## Code Availability

The source code for VISTA will be made available upon the camera-ready submission of our paper. Please check back later for the complete implementation.

## Stay Tuned

We are preparing the codebase for public release. The repository will include:
- Implementation of the VISTA system
- Sample visualization scenarios used in our study
- Documentation for deployment and customization

We appreciate your interest in our work and look forward to sharing the complete implementation soon!ðŸ¤—
